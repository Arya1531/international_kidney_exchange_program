Purpose: computational study for Computing Balanced Solutions for Large International Kidney Exchange Schemes When Maximum Cycle Length Is Unbounded or $3$

We run our simulations both without and with (‚Äú+ùëê‚Äù) using the credit system. This leads to the five scenarios for each of the six selected
solution concepts, the Shapley value, nucleolus, Banzhaf value, tau value, benefit value and contribution value.

Please note that the data and seeds remain the same for cases where the maximum cycle length is either unbounded or $3$. They can be found under the directories:

  Data: international_kidney_exchange_program/data,

  Seeds: international_kidney_exchange_program/seeds.

The sources are available at:

  Unbounded case: international_kidney_exchange_program/sources/unbounded.zip,

  Length-$3$ Case: international_kidney_exchange_program/sources/length-3.zip.
